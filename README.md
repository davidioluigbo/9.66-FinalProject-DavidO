**Overview**

The goal of this study was to compare how humans and probabilistic models predict future game outcomes. By examining participantsâ€™ probabilistic reasoning and contrasting it with the outputs of mathematical models, this study aimed to identify the ways in which humans process sequential dependencies and integrate contextual information, such as streak lengths and scoring trends, into their predictions.
